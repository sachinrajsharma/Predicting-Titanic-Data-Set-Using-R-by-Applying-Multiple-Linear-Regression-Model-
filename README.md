# Predicting-Titanic-Data-Set-Using-R-by-Applying-Multiple-Linear-Regression-Model-
# The code written in R 
# You can use the code for learning purpose to predict the famous Titanic Model by using Multiple Linear Regression 
# I have mentioned in detail how to clean the data, how to handle Categorical Data, how to handle missing data which are the most important steps to analyse any data set, which will definitely help you to prepare for future R - projects in data science.
